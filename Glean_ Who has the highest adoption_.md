For the last 30 days (Jan 13–Feb 11, 2026), adoption is strongest in these departments (focusing on teams with meaningful size and headcount data):

## **Who has the highest adoption?**

Using **coverage (signups ÷ employees)** plus **activity (MAU ÷ signups)** and **stickiness (WAU ÷ MAU)**:

1. **CX**

   * Coverage: **100%** (51/51 signed up)  
   * Activity: \~**98%** (50 MAU / 51 signups)  
   * Stickiness: \~**94%** (47 WAU / 50 MAU)  
   * Usage: 5,164 chats and 383 searches in the period.  
2. **SALES – AE**

   * Coverage: **100%** (50/50)  
   * Activity: \~**92%** (46/50)  
   * Stickiness: \~**83%** (38/46)  
   * Usage: 1,544 chats, 290 searches.  
3. **SUPPORT**

   * Coverage: **97%** (97/100)  
   * Activity: \~**89%** (86/97)  
   * Stickiness: \~**91%** (78/86)  
   * Usage intensity: **12,672 chats** and 1,829 searches – among the highest total volumes.  
4. **PS (Professional Services)**

   * Coverage: \~**95%** (52/55)  
   * Activity: \~**90%** (47/52)  
   * Stickiness: \~**81%** (38/47)  
   * Usage: 2,924 chats, 389 searches.  
5. **REV – SENG (Sales Engineering)**

   * Coverage: \~**95%** (38/40)  
   * Activity: \~**95%** (36/38)  
   * Stickiness: \~**83%** (30/36)  
   * Usage: 2,481 chats, 436 searches.

Smaller teams like **TAM** and **REV – ARCH** also show near‑perfect adoption (100% coverage and very high activity/stickiness), but on a much smaller employee base.

## **What seems to be driving adoption?**

Patterns across the top departments:

* **Customer-facing workflows align well with Glean**  
  * CX, Support, PS, Sales AE, and Sales Engineering all have high chat volumes per active user, indicating Glean is embedded in day‑to‑day case handling, deal work, and customer communication.  
    * SUPPORT: \~147 chats per active user (12,672 chats / 86 MAU).  
    * CX: \~103 chats per active user (5,164 / 50).  
    * REV – SENG & PS: \~60–70 chats per active user.  
* **Strong internal champions / power users**  
  * The power‑user list is dominated by people in **SUPPORT, CX, PS, REV – SENG, SALES – AE/AM/BDR, and OPS – IT**, suggesting local champions are driving habit formation (e.g., multiple SUPPORT agents with 600–900 chats each, CX reps with several hundred chats, PS consultants with 300–400 chats).  
* **High breadth and depth together**  
  * These teams don’t just have many signups; nearly everyone who signed up is active monthly and returns weekly. That combination (high coverage \+ high stickiness) is typical where:  
    * Glean is part of the standard operating procedure (e.g., used to answer tickets, prep customer calls), and  
    * Managers and enablement teams reinforce usage.

If you’d like, I can next compare these high‑adoption teams with one or two specific lower‑adoption departments to pinpoint what’s missing there (e.g., lack of champions vs. workflow fit).
