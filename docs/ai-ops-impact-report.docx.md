# **Glean: the company's AI teammate**

**ENTERPRISE KNOWLEDGE SEARCH \+ AI ASSISTANT \+ AGENT BUILDER**

Glean became Docebo's most widely adopted AI platform within three months of launch. It combines enterprise search, a conversational AI assistant, and a no-code agent builder into a single surface that connects to Salesforce, Gong, Confluence, Google Drive, Slack, Zendesk, and more.

## **Adoption at a glance**

| 600+ MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS | 420 WEEKLY ACTIVE USERS | 69K+ SEARCHES IN 6 MONTHS |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

| 80%+ GTM TEAM ADOPTION | 180+ MONTHLY AGENT USERS | 69% WAU/MAU STICKINESS |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

A critical behavior shift: employees now run roughly five AI-assisted chats per week versus 2.7 traditional keyword searches; an assistant-first workflow is taking hold across the organization.

## **Agent ecosystem**

The Glean agent ecosystem grew to 140+ custom agents shared across the company with 173 agents in production. High-impact examples include:

| Agent | Runs | Active users | Owner |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Next Step Helper | 1,269 | Team-wide | Rev Enablement |
| Renewal Plan Generator | 969 | CX team | Customer Success |
| Product FAQ | 600 | 90 | Natalie Yamakami |
| REACH Scoring | 483 | Sales | Revenue Ops |

### **Spotlight: Product FAQ agent**

Built by Natalie Yamakami in Revenue Enablement, the Product FAQ agent became the gold-standard example of how to develop, test, and roll out an AI agent at Docebo. Key results:

* 93% reduction in search time (15 minutes down to under one minute)

* Roughly two hours saved per rep per week

* 600 runs by 90 users in two months (third most-used agent company-wide)

* Quality scores: 94% task success, 96% grounding accuracy, NPS of 100 in pilot

|  | *"It helped me answer a question on a call in real-time. That would have taken roughly 30 minutes before."* ; Sales rep, Product FAQ pilot |
| :---- | :---- |

## **Agent Builder Certification program**

To scale agent creation beyond the AI Ops team, we launched a structured enablement cohort where employees learn to build, test, and deploy Glean agents themselves.

| Metric | Cohort 1 result |
| :---- | :---- |
| Participants | 22 |
| Certified builders | 11 |
| Production agents shipped | 11+ |
| Total sign-ups (both cohorts) | 74 |
| Average skill uplift | 28.9% across AI competencies |
| Ability to build agents (uplift) | \+40.5% |
| NPS | 9.73 / 10 |

Sign-ups skew heavily toward GTM roles: Support (16), Solutions Engineering (13), Customer Success (9), Sales (8), and Marketing (7). Cohort 2 is currently in progress.

## **Economic impact**

* Projected $2.2M annual value across time savings and capacity creation

* 19+ FTE-equivalent capacity created in Customer Success alone

* 87% adoption in the initial pilot; 62% of users report saving 5-60 minutes per day

* 30-75 minute reductions in call and QBR preparation time

* 5-9 hours per week saved for power users in CS, Sales, and Support

# **UnifyApps: the GTM intelligence portal**

**LOW-CODE AI APPLICATION BUILDER WITH UNIFIED DATA CONNECTORS**

UnifyApps connects Gong, Salesforce, Totango, Qualtrics, Snowflake, and Zendesk into a single platform where the AI Ops team builds production applications for GTM teams. Four core apps are live today with 18 use cases in the pipeline (roughly four to five delivered per quarter).

### **Audience Insights AI (Marketing)**

This app analyzes 4,000+ demo calls recorded in Gong since January 2024, refreshing daily. Marketing uses it to identify buyer pain points, competitive mentions, and messaging opportunities straight from the voice of the customer.

* 50% target reduction in pre-meeting research time

* 40% faster time-to-market for new messaging

* 45% faster reaction to competitive mentions

* Estimated $3.3M incremental pipeline from AI-informed campaign tests (15% uplift on 442-SQO sample); upside scenarios model up to $9.05M at scale

|  | *"I use this daily. It is my go-to resource for voice of customer. It bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insight."* ; Amanda Aschoff, Marketing |
| :---- | :---- |

### **Churn Analysis AI / Closed-Lost Intelligence**

Automatically classifies roughly 200 lost opportunities per month with approximately 95% accuracy and writes standardized churn reasons back into Salesforce. A companion Glean agent layers narrative context from Gong, Zendesk, Slack, and email to give leaders a clear picture of why deals are lost.

### **Digital Business Review and one-pager for CS**

Hundreds of accounts were going without structured business reviews. These apps auto-generate decks and one-pagers from Snowflake, Totango, Gong, Salesforce, and Qualtrics data, targeting a 60% reduction in QBR prep time (90 minutes down to under 30\) and a 60% increase in account coverage. Currently in UAT with a pilot cohort of CSMs, targeting go-live in February 2026\.

### **Account Handoff Automation (Q1 2026 priority)**

AI-powered handoff document generation that pulls context from Gong calls, RFPs, Slack threads, Google Docs, and Salesforce to create standardized living documents for the AE-to-PS and PS-to-CSM transitions. Modeling estimates two to four hours saved per AE handoff and one to three hours per PS project intake across 150 handoffs per month.

# **Granola: meeting intelligence at scale**

**AI-POWERED MEETING NOTEPAD WITH LOCAL PROCESSING**

Granola enhances meeting notes using AI while processing data locally for privacy. After a 60-day proof of concept, it was approved for 210 licenses and is now in full production.

| 300+ SIGN-UPS | 200+ ACTIVE USERS | 97% USER SATISFACTION |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

| 20 min SAVED PER MEETING | 1,983% CALCULATED ROI | $650K PROJECTED ANNUAL VALUE |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

## **The math**

* 210 users averaging 10 meetings per week, saving 20 minutes per meeting \= 17,500 hours saved annually

* At $75 per hour loaded cost, that represents $1.3M in productivity value

* Annual cost: $63,000 (210 licenses at $25 per user per month)

* Payback period: under one month

## **Where it's used**

Granola spans every function: HR uses it for interview documentation, Sales for customer call follow-ups, CS for client interaction tracking, Product for sprint discussions, and all teams for cross-functional meetings and knowledge sharing.

|  | *"I spend so much of my time in meetings and this has changed my ability to not only review notes but ensure I don't miss anything. I can ask it at the end of the week 'what are my action items' and it does a pretty good job of grabbing everything."* ; Meeting pilot participant |
| :---- | :---- |

|  | *"Every Monday, we share three big rocks with the Marketing team. I always use Granola to help me define mine; I just reference last week's meeting notes so I don't have to rely on memory or dig through docs."* ; Marketing team member |

# **Zapier: automation and enablement**

**WORKFLOW AUTOMATION CONNECTING APPS AND AI**

Zapier enables teams to automate repetitive workflows without engineering support. In roughly two months of enterprise deployment, the platform has become the connective tissue between Docebo's AI tools.

| 50+ WORKFLOWS IN PRODUCTION | 88K CREDITS USED (OF 600K) | 200K+ PROJECTED ANNUAL USAGE |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

## **Enablement approach**

The AI Ops team ran a Zapier AI Bootcamp in December 2025, teaching the FAR framework (Frequent, Annoying, Repeatable) to help employees identify their own automation opportunities. Each participant built one AI workflow and one AI agent during the session. A published enablement guide and dedicated AI Hub section provide ongoing self-service resources.

Cross-functional workflows span GTM, Support, CS, Finance, and Marketing. One concrete example: a Granola-to-Drive-to-Slack automation that processes meeting notes, tags action items, and routes them to the right channels automatically.

# **Zendesk AI: customer support transformation**

**AI SUITE: CHATBOT, COPILOT, OMNICHANNEL, TALK, FEDERATED SEARCH**

Zendesk AI was deployed to 100% of the customer base, managed by the Support team with AI Ops providing strategic oversight. The impact on support operations has been substantial and measurable.

| 46% TICKETS AI-ACCELERATED | 21% FASTER TIME TO RESOLUTION | 96.8% CSAT MAINTAINED |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

## **Key metrics**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Time to resolution | 56 hours | 44 hours | 21% faster |
| First reply time | 75 minutes | 67 minutes | 11% faster |
| Chat response time | 74 seconds | 5 seconds | 93% faster |
| AI chatbot L1 resolution | N/A | 17-30% | Target: 35%+ |

## **Economic impact**

* Chat response automation: roughly 8,000 chats per month, 1.15 minutes saved per chat, approximately 153 hours and $8,415 per month in value

* Supporting 15% more cases without adding headcount

* Lower cost per ticket by approximately 10%

* Infrastructure to handle 3x current volume without proportional headcount growth

# **LLM strategy: Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini**

**GOVERNED ACCESS TO FRONTIER AI MODELS**

Rather than letting LLM usage sprawl uncontrolled, AI Ops implemented a governance-first approach: right-size licenses to actual usage, steer users toward the best tool for their workflow, and consolidate where possible.

## **Gemini (Google Workspace)**

* 480+ users via existing Google Workspace integration

* 85% actively using Gemini; 70% actively use the chat LLM

* 46 interactions per active user on average

* 28% of users active 11+ days per month (consistent engagement)

* Positioned as the primary LLM for most employees, reducing the need for additional seat purchases

## **ChatGPT Enterprise**

Seats grew unchecked from 100 to 190 before AI Ops intervened. After a usage review, licenses were reduced to 116 by removing users with fewer than 50 messages over a two-month period. Remaining heavy users were offered pathways to Gemini or Glean (which includes GPT-5 capabilities). This governance action reduced waste and channeled budget toward higher-impact tools.

## **Claude (Anthropic)**

Starting with 18 seats for technical teams, demand has spiked due to Claude Code and Opus 4.5 capabilities. Usage is concentrated in Solutions Architecture, Engineering, and agent development workflows. The team manages seat allocation through a structured request process with clear acceptance criteria, not social media hype.

# **Emerging tools: Claude Code, Cowork, Lovable, and Cursor**

**BUILDING CAPABILITY FOR THE NEXT WAVE**

## **Claude Code and Cowork**

Claude Code brings AI-assisted development directly into the terminal, enabling technical and semi-technical employees to build tools, automate processes, and ship prototypes faster. The philosophy is 'builders, not chatters'; employees start with personal licenses, prove value, then request company-funded access. A dedicated \#claude-coders Slack channel fosters community learning. Cowork extends this capability for non-developers, providing a desktop tool for file and task management automation.

## **Lovable**

Connected to Jira via the Atlassian MCP Server, Lovable enables the team to build richer cross-project views and automations over Jira boards. Use cases include unified project dashboards, overlap and dependency detection, and intelligent triggers across multiple project boards.

## **Cursor**

An AI-powered code assistant adopted by 150+ users. Engineering teams use it for AI-suggested code completion, multi-file editing, and debugging. AI-suggested code deletions stand at 55%, indicating strong trust in the tool's ability to simplify codebases. The UX Library team has integrated Cursor with the Elemental Library for component development.

# **How we operate**

**GOVERNANCE, INTAKE, AND OPERATING MODEL**

AI Ops doesn't just deploy tools; it runs the operating system that makes them work together. The team functions as the orchestrator of the AI stack, enabling wins for Marketing, RevOps, CS, Sales, and Support through solution design, program management, and structured enablement.

## **Governance structures**

* AI \+ Salesforce Executive Steering Committee (monthly, 60 minutes) for exec-level prioritization and budget decisions

* Weekly SFDC, Business Technology, and AI syncs for operational coordination

* AI Initiatives Steering working sessions for champions and project owners

* Daily UnifyApps sprint calls with two FTE project leads and a PM on the vendor side

## **Intake and capacity management**

All AI and Salesforce requests flow through a governed intake process. UnifyApps delivers roughly four to five use cases per quarter, sized from small to extra-large. Each initiative follows a clear lifecycle: Discovery, Build, UAT, Go-live. The Rev Team SFxAI Project Inventory tracks 20+ AI projects with status, ownership, and dependencies.

## **Enablement flywheel**

The team invests in self-service capability: the Agent Builder Certification cohorts, the Zapier AI Bootcamp, the Internal AI Hub on Google Sites, and upcoming Innovation Showcase with a $5,000 prize pool targeting 30+ submissions and 10% company participation. The goal is to make every team a builder, not just a consumer of AI tools.
