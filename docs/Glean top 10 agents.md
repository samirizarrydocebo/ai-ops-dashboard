## **2\) How are they used across the org?**

From the department usage data:

* **Customer teams (CX, PS, TAM, Renewals)**  
  * **CX:** 49 agent users, **2,167 runs**; top agent is **Renewal Plan Generator**.  
  * **PS:** 33 users, **263 runs**; top agent is **Product FAQ Agent**.  
  * **TAM & Renewals** also list **Product FAQ Agent / Intelligent reminders** as their top agents.  
  * Interpretation: agents are heavily embedded in **renewal planning, customer briefing, and support for CSMs/TAMs**, not just experimentation.  
* **Sales & Revenue org (AE, AM, BDR, SEng, Rev Mgmt/Enb/Ops/Arch)**  
  * **SALES \- AE:** 40 users, **667 runs**; **Outbounding Prompt** is the top agent → agents are a core part of outbound and opportunity prep.  
  * **SALES \- AM:** 30 users, **511 runs**; top agent **Account Growth Plan (REACH informed)** → agents drive structured growth/expansion planning.  
  * **SALES \- BDR:** 11 users, **34 runs**, also centered on **Outbounding Prompt**.  
  * **REV \- SENG:** 29 users, **1,002 runs**; top agent **Demo Prep Agent** → shows deep adoption in pre‑demo preparation.  
  * **REV \- ARCH / ENB / OPS / MGMT** collectively use **Integrations Finder, Enablement Request Evaluator, Account Plan Agent**, etc.  
  * Interpretation: agents are now standard tooling in the **revenue engine** for prospecting, demos, and account planning.  
* **Support & Security**  
  * **SUPPORT:** 47 users, **513 runs**; previously heavy use of **Northstar** (now deleted).  
  * **OPS \- INFOSEC:** 2 users, **209 runs**; top agent **Cybersecurity Slack Q\&A Agent**.  
  * Interpretation: support and security use agents as **specialized Q\&A and triage helpers**, especially in Slack.  
* **Product & Engineering**  
  * **RD \- MGMT / RD \- COPS / RD \- DATA / RD \- TW / RD \- DEV:** lower absolute volumes (tens of runs), using **Product FAQ Agent, CloudOps Incident Analysis, Learn Data Explorer, OR Report Agent**, etc.  
  * Interpretation: adoption is more pockets of use (incident analysis, data exploration, reporting), but not yet as standardized as in CX/Rev.

Overall pattern:

* **Revenue & CX** are the heaviest consumers of the top agents.  
* Agents are oriented around **repeatable workflows**: outbounding, demo prep, renewal/growth planning, standard FAQs, scoring & reports.

## **3\) What impact are these agents having?**

### **a) Breadth of impact**

* Top agent alone (**Product FAQ Agent**) touches **121 unique users**, cutting across multiple departments (PS, CX, PS, Renewals, Marketing).  
* Revenue‑focused agents (**Outbounding Prompt, Demo Prep, Account Growth/Growth tools, REACH**) collectively involve **dozens of AEs, AMs, BDRs, and sales engineers**, with thousands of runs across AE/AM/BDR/REV‑SENG/CX.

This indicates that a large portion of your **frontline customer and revenue teams** are incorporating agents into daily workflows.

### **b) Depth / intensity**

* Several agents show **high run counts per user**, suggesting they’re embedded in repeat processes:  
  * **REACH Scoring and Summary Report Generation:** 32 users, **653 runs** → used repeatedly for scorecards/reports.  
  * **Renewal Plan Generator:** 41 users, **348 runs** → multiple runs per user for iterative plan updates.  
  * **Northstar**: 34 users, **324 runs** before deprecation.

Even if we conservatively assume **5–10 minutes saved per run**, those high‑volume agents alone represent **hundreds of hours of effort shifted from manual prep to AI** over the 90‑day window.

### **c) Quality / satisfaction**

* For the top 10: **13 upvotes vs only 2 downvotes** total.  
* The only top‑10 agent with notable negative feedback is the **Cybersecurity Slack Q\&A Agent** (3 downvotes, 0 upvotes overall), which is not in the top‑10 by user count but still important because of its security sensitivity.  
* Signal: overall, your most‑used agents have **positive or neutral feedback**, supporting the case that they are delivering reliable value.

### **d) Organizational story you can tell**

When you talk about “impact across the org,” you can credibly say:

* Agents are **widely adopted** in CX and Revenue (dozens of active users per team, thousands of runs), especially for:  
  * Renewal and growth planning  
  * Demo and meeting prep  
  * Outbound/prospecting messages  
  * Standard product FAQs and customer briefings  
* Support and InfoSec use agents for **specialized Q\&A and incident/security use cases**, showing that non‑revenue teams are also benefiting.  
* The top 10 agents alone account for about **3,000 automated workflow runs in 90 days**, indicating that a significant amount of previously manual document‑hunting, note‑writing, and plan‑structuring has been automated.
