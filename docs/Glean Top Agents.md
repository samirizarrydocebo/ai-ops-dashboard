As of the last 30 days (Jan 13–Feb 11, 2026), your highest‑performing agents cluster around a few clear workflows: sales outbounding, account/renewal planning, customer transition/readiness, support/security Q\&A, and product/tech documentation.

Below is a concise view of the standouts, what they *likely* do based on their names, and which teams are leaning on them.

---

## **1\. Org‑wide top agents**

By unique users and run volume:

1. **Product FAQ Agent**

   * **Usage:** 57 users, 246 runs  
   * **Who uses it:**  
     * Documentation & writing: **RD – TW** (top agent in the team)  
     * Renewals: **RENEWALS** (top agent)  
     * Product & eng leadership: **RD – MGMT** (top agent)  
   * **What it likely does:** Central FAQ assistant over product docs, helping teams answer “how does X work?” quickly and keep messaging consistent during customer interactions.  
2. **Outbounding Prompt**

   * **Usage:** 33 users, 170 runs  
   * **Who uses it:**  
     * Core sales: **SALES – AE** (top agent)  
     * Pipeline gen: **SALES – BDR** (top agent)  
   * **What it likely does:** Helps AEs/BDRs craft outbound emails/messages or call openers, probably tailored by persona/segment, to speed up high‑volume outbounding while keeping tone and positioning on brand.  
3. **Transition Readiness Agent**

   * **Usage:** 22 users, 42 runs  
   * **Who uses it:**  
     * Customer experience: **CX** (top agent in a large, very active team: 41 users, 616 runs across all agents)  
   * **What it likely does:** Evaluates whether a customer is ready for a specific transition (onboarding phase, go‑live, phase change, or handoff), assembling signals from multiple systems/docs into a single readiness summary.  
4. **Account Growth Plan (REACH informed) \[v1.0\]**

   * **Usage:** 21 users, 42 runs  
   * **Who uses it:**  
     * **SALES – AM** (top agent; 26 users, 198 total runs for agents in that team)  
   * **What it likely does:** Generates structured account growth plans using REACH data/signals (e.g., adoption, engagement, risk, upsell levers) so account managers can standardize QBR prep and expansion strategies.  
5. **RFP Response Chatbot**

   * **Usage:** 7 users, **549 runs** (very high run count)  
   * **Who uses it:** Spread across several go‑to‑market and enablement users, not concentrated in one department as a “top” agent—but it’s hammered by a small core group.  
   * **What it likely does:** Assists with RFP responses: pulling standard language, answering RFP questions from your corpus, and drafting responses so proposal owners can work much faster.  
6. **Cybersecurity Slack Q\&A Agent**

   * **Usage:** 9 users, 101 runs  
   * **Who uses it:**  
     * Security & infra: **OPS – INFOSEC** (top agent)  
     * Sales partners: **SALES – PARTNER** (top agent)  
     * HR: **HR** (top agent)  
   * **What it likely does:** Answers internal questions about cybersecurity policies, procedures, and standards—likely embedded in Slack—reducing ad‑hoc questions to InfoSec and giving HR/partner teams quick, consistent guidance.  
7. **Demo Prep Agent**

   * **Usage:** 14 users, 74 runs  
   * **Who uses it:**  
     * Sales engineering: **REV – SENG** (top agent; 21 users, 704 runs overall)  
     * AI/R\&D: **RD – AI** (top agent)  
   * **What it likely does:** Creates demo briefs or tailored demo flows using opportunity, industry, or past call notes so SEs can start from a high‑quality outline instead of a blank slate.  
8. **Renewal Plan Generator**

   * **Usage:** 18 users, 67 runs  
   * **Who uses it:** Likely concentrated in CX / CSM‑like roles (usage is org‑wide but below “top agent” thresholds in some teams).  
   * **What it likely does:** Drafts renewal strategies and actions for at‑risk or upcoming renewals, standardizing how CSMs approach renewals.

## **2\. How different teams are using agents**

From the department‑level view, here’s how teams are operationalizing agents in practice:

* **Customer Experience (CX)**

  * **Usage:** 41 users, 616 runs (one of the heaviest adopters).  
  * **Top agent:** **Transition Readiness Agent**  
  * **Pattern:** CX is using agents for structured customer lifecycle workflows—transition readiness, renewal planning, and likely customer health narratives.  
* **Sales Account Executives & AMs (SALES – AE, SALES – AM)**

  * **AE:** 33 users, 265 runs; top agent **Outbounding Prompt**  
  * **AM:** 26 users, 198 runs; top agent **Account Growth Plan (REACH informed)**  
  * **Pattern:** AEs focus on high‑frequency outbound content; AMs focus on strategic account planning and expansions.  
* **Sales Engineering (REV – SENG)**

  * **Usage:** 21 users, 704 runs (very heavy users).  
  * **Top agent:** **Demo Prep Agent**  
  * **Pattern:** Agents are firmly in the pre‑call/demo workflow, turning fragmented info into demo briefs or narratives.  
* **Professional Services (PS)**

  * **Usage:** 27 users, 153 runs.  
  * **Top agent:** **Migration Master Questions**  
  * **Pattern:** Agents help standardize discovery/migration questions, project briefs, and status reporting across projects.  
* **Support & COPS (SUPPORT, RD – COPS)**

  * **SUPPORT:** 21 users, 90 runs; top agent **Q\&A COPS Bot**  
  * **RD – COPS:** 2 users, 7 runs; top agent **CloudOps Incident Analysis Agent**  
  * **Pattern:** Tiered usage—frontline support uses Q\&A bots; CloudOps uses specialized analysis agents for incident review and diagnosis.  
* **Security & Risk (OPS – INFOSEC, HR, SALES – PARTNER)**

  * All three have **Cybersecurity Slack Q\&A Agent** as their top agent.  
  * **Pattern:** A shared, cross‑functional security knowledge bot that reduces repeated questions and ensures consistent answers across departments.  
* **Product & R\&D (RD – TW, RD – MGMT, RD – DEV)**

  * **RD – TW & RD – MGMT:** top agent **Product FAQ Agent**  
  * **RD – DEV:** top agent **OR Report Agent**  
  * **Pattern:** Product and eng leadership lean on FAQ and reporting agents, while dev has early adoption of more technical agents like OR reporting and incident analysis.  
* **Ops & Enablement (OPS – IT, REV – ENB, OPS – CORPORATE)**

  * **OPS – IT:** top agent **OKR Creation: Alignment Editor**  
  * **REV – ENB:** top agent **Enablement Request Evaluator (Effort Matrix \+ Proposal Builder)**  
  * **OPS – CORPORATE:** top agent **\[E-Team Test\] My Intelligent reminders**  
  * **Pattern:** These teams use agents to standardize planning (OKRs), triage enablement requests, and build early prototypes of “assistant‑like” reminders/ops automation.

## **3\. What “highest performing” means here**

Based on the last 30 days:

* **Broadest adoption (most unique users):**  
  * Product FAQ Agent  
  * Outbounding Prompt  
  * Transition Readiness Agent  
  * Account Growth Plan (REACH informed)  
* **Most intensive usage by a smaller core (run‑heavy):**  
  * RFP Response Chatbot (549 runs, 7 users)  
  * Demo Prep Agent (74 runs, 14 users)  
  * Cybersecurity Slack Q\&A Agent (101 runs, 9 users)

I can’t see the internal configuration/steps of each agent, but their **names plus the team‑level usage patterns** show a clear trend: your highest performers are those that are embedded in **repeatable, high‑leverage workflows** (outbound, demos, transitions, renewals, RFPs, support triage, and security Q\&A).
